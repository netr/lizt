# TODO

### Functionality
- Write `t.Parallel()` tests for all the Next Iterators to ensure they are thread safe
- Create `PersistTo` functionality for the Builder
 
### Persisters
- Write IniPersister

#### ?? Persisters
- Write YamlPersister (maybe)
- Write JSONPersister (probably slow)
- Write RedisPersister (kind of pointless from a sync perspective. could work for global store?)
